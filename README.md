# obs-source-transition
This is a simple OBS python plugin that allows any number of sources to be faded in then (optionally) out over a specified duration and after a specified delay when activated. Forked from Ben Dodds' original script

Original Script located at https://bitbucket.org/bendodds/obs-source-transition/src/master/

Modified *hacked* the script to force it to become visible again on a hotkey press
